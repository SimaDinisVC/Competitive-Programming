# TECLA
 Here I will put my resolutions of the exercises of a campaign of the University of Aveiro called TECLA.
 Mooshak is the platform that accepts the code and evaluates that it was also developed by the University of Aveiro.

 I decided to publish this repository, because I already finished the 2022 phase, unfortunately I couldn't pass the qualifying phase that day was not a productive day for me. Next year there is more and I hope to exceed my expectations.
 However, this school year will take place on the same Mooshak platform as the National Computer Olympics and I hope to be able to redeem myself.
